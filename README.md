# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a Supervised ML Algorithm. You give the algorithm the inputs and it tries to find the outputs. If the data has one input, it tries to find a line through the data. If the data has two inputs, it tries to find a plane through the data.
In the example below, Weight is the input and Height is the output.
